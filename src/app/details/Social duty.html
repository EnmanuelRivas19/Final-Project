    <p>We endeavor to be responsible in our impact on society and the environment at Hodelpa Hotels. Our social duty is a way of life for us, and we are always giving back to the communities where we live, whether in the form of financial contributions or volunteer services in which our workers enthusiastically participate. In a number of approaches, we stress environmental issues, social participation, and patronage.
